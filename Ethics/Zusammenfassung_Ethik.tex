\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Need for Ethics}
The fundamental question of ethics is \textquotedblleft What should I do\textquotedblright. This question reflects freedom and commitment, but an individual should also
\begin{itemize}[label=-, nosep]
	\item be good
	\item behave well
	\item strive for good conditions
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Ethics can help in this aspect in the following way
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item As a guideline for human action
	\item Ethical debates are advice for laws
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[tbh]

\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Morality} is what at a certain time in a certain society is generally considered good and desirable or evil and forbidden as an action, condition, or attitude is collectively called the prevailing morality \parencite{gobel2013unternehmensethik}.
	
	\vspace*{1em}
	\noindent
	Morality only means that a system of norms claims to be valid, not that it is justified.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Law} can be understood as a system of positive coercive norms applying to individuals, including sanctions associated with them.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Ethos} refers to a subject who recognizes a certain morality as a requirement for his or her actions and to actions that are consistently marked by recognition.
\end{definition}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/ethos}
\end{center}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Ethics} in general can be described as the teaching or the science of morals and ethos.
\end{definition}

Ethics analyses the answers provided by different forms of morality to questions on what one should do, one's duties and rights, what can be considered good and bad, and what is right or wrong.

\end{figure}


\section{Virtue Ethics}
Virtue ethics is an ethical mindset that places the emphasis of moral judgment on the motivation for human behaviour. This can either be an isolated thought that prevails at a given moment and causes a particular action to be taken. Or it can be a permanent attitude that develops over time and shapes an individual’s conduct over an entire life \parencite{hubner2018einfuhrung}.

Different virtue ethics focus on the motivation for human action. The actual actions of an individual or the consequences of these actions are not completely disregarded, but are not the prime object of moral judgement. Virtues are often defined in such a way that they strongly recommend an action or desirable consequences. Virtue ethicists do not make any strong recommendations regarding precise actions but are only concerned with the nature of these actions.

The main concepts rooted in ancient Greek philosophy are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{arête} - excellence or virtue
	\item \emph{phronesis} - practical or moral wisdom
	\item \emph{eudaimonia} - translated as happiness or flourishing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plato's Parts of the Soul and Virtues}
Plato was the first to really think about these aspects and write it down! According to Plato the soul consists of three parts
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Logos}, the part related to reason, which regulates the mind, and is important for insight and judgement
	\item \textit{Thymos}, the part related to anger, strength and assertiveness
	\item \textit{Eros}, the part related to desire, emotions and passion
\end{itemize}

\noindent
He identifies these four cardinal virtues which are true for the individual and the state
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Virtue} & \textbf{Connection to the Parts of the Soul}\\
	\hline
	Prudence & Reason (rulers) recognizes the appropriate course of action for the soul \\
	Fortitude & Courage (guardians) persists in what has been recognized through reason. \\
	Temperance & All parts of the soul (all citizens) agree that reason (rulers) should rule. \\
	Justice & Every part of the soul contributes (is met if the three other virtues prevail) \\
	\hline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Nicomachian Ethics}
Virtue of thinking needs teaching, experience and time, virtue of character (moral virtue) comes about as a consequence of following the right habits. According to Aristotle the potential for this virtue is by nature in humans, but whether virtues come to be present or not is not determined by human nature.

For Aristotle virtues are \textbf{positive}, \textbf{medium character traits} which must be in line with the nature of people, and their actions should be guided by \textbf{reason} and \textbf{insight}.

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{theological concept} states that if an individual in a community behaves according to the virtue doctrine, he or she will lead a happy life and be considered ethical.
\end{definition}

According to Aristotle the \textbf{highest good} is \textquotedblleft living well\textquotedblright, to always strive for a good life for its own sake. \textbf{Good behaviour is, therefore, the moral goal,} and the highest goal can only be realized in the behaviour itself.

It must be the highest goal of human behaviour to realize reasonableness to the highest degree. Happiness, therefore, consists in acting according to a highly developed reason. This reason is, however, only highly developed if it is of a virtuous nature. Acting out of virtue or virtuous action by the human soul is the highest goal (\textbf{eudaimonia}).

Aristotle distinguishes between two categories of virtue
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l @{\hskip 2cm} l}
	\textbf{Intellectual} & \textbf{Ethical}\\
	\hline
	Wisdom & Generosity \\
	Prudence & Considerateness \\
	Perception & Courage \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsubsection{Criticism of Aristotelian Ethics}
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Aristotelian ethics cannot make concrete recommendations
	\item Aristotelian ethics is too relative
	\item The virtuous life does not always lead to a happy life
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise Answers}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{What are the three normative approaches introduced in the text?}\\
	\textbf{Virtue ethics}, which emphasises virtues or moral character; \textbf{Deontology}, which emphasises duties or rules; \textbf{Consequentialism}, which emphasises consequences or results. Each approach can consider virtues, consequences, and rules, there is no strict separation in all the cases
	\item \textbf{How is virtue ethics distinguished from the two others?}\\
	Virtue ethics in contrast to an ethical approach focussing on rules (deontology) and the approach focussing on the consequences of actions (consequentialism) focusses on the behaviour or intent of the individual acting virtuous. A virtuous individual is not just so by virtue itself, but has a virtuous mind which lets the person act in a virtuous way in any circumstance, and with ease. Thus such an individual is said to posses "full or perfect virtue" in contrast to a person which has to control his impulses to act virtuous.\\
	What distinguishes virtue ethics from consequentialism or deontology is the \textbf{centrality} of virtue within the theory. Consequentialists will define virtues as traits that yield good consequences and deontologists will define them as traits possessed by those who reliably fulfil their duties, but virtue ethics view them as fundamental. Virtue ethics does not define virtues as traits that yield good consequences or as traits possessed by those who reliably fulfil their duties, but sets the foundation with virtues and vices for other normative notions to be grounded in it.
	\item \textbf{How is arête (excellence or virtue) defined in the text?}\\
	As an excellent trait of character which enables an individual to act in a virtuous manner. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset. A significant aspect of this mindset is the wholehearted acceptance of a distinctive range of considerations as reasons for action.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deontological Ethics}
Deontological Ethics, \textit{deon} meaning \textquotedblleft obligation\textquotedblright\ in Greek, try to answer the question which norms and actions a person should do to be ethical. The most representative of a deontological approach is by Immanuel Kant:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item The goal of ethics is the observance of what is ethically correct
	\item The ethically good depends on the ethically correct
	\item The ethically correct is \textbf{independent of the consequences}
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Duty} is an action to which a person is obliged. \parencite{kant1870grundlegung}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{The Categorical Imperative} is to act as if the maxims of your behaviour could, through your will, serve at any time as the basis of a general law. \parencite{kant1870grundlegung}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Morality} is to do what is your duty (to follow absolutely valid norms of action) and do it out of duty (with a moral attitude).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Kant's Deontological Ethics}
Kant's deontological ethics are based on the idea that only free will that rules an autonomous action determines the ethical quality of an action, and that every individual has dignity and a free will. As a result, only the responsibility for actions resulting from freedom to act or autonomy can be judged ethically.

Kant's conception of freedom is to act freely, that is to act autonomously and guided by a law given by the individual itself. The opposite of autonomy is heteronomy, that is to act according to desires the individual has not chosen itself. While the value of an action can only be measured by the intention behind it, the quality of this intention can only be judged by the \textbf{action maxim} chosen by the subject. This capacity to act freely is what gives human lives its special dignity, and to respect this dignity means regarding people not just as a means to an end but as ends in themselves.

\subsection{The Categorical Imperative}
An action is morally correct if it follows maxims which are good in themselves.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Act only according to a maxim according which you can also want it to become a universal law
	\item Act as if the maxims of your behaviour could, through your will, serve at any time as the basis of a universal law of nature
	\item Act as if you always need humanity, both in yourself and in the person of everyone else, as an end in itself, never merely as a means to an end
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Human Rights}
Human rights are basic rights and every human being is entitled to them by nature. These rights apply \textbf{regardless of place and time} and are codified in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

\subsection{Principles of Discourse Ethics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Communicative action as a referential framework for the lifeworld of a society
	\item Solving conflicts by means \textbf{non-violent communication} and with \textbf{rational arguments}
	\item \textbf{Human rights} as basis
	\item In an ideal, practical discourse all those involved participate and agree to a norm in the end
	\item Reasons must be given, Fairness and Consequences
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Theory of Justice}
The original position is the contract-theoretical justification of principles. Justice should be fairness, and there is a principle of impartiality or a "veil of ignorance".

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Distributive justice}, to each the same, according to the performance, according to the needs
	\item \textbf{Retributive justice}, exchange of equivalent values, according to the work performed, practical or market value
	\item \textbf{Corrective justice}, reparation, compensation, sanctions
	\item \textbf{Procedural justice}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item perfect, one distributes the other chooses
		\item imperfect, court trials or political decisions
		\item pure, a draw, randomness
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Principles}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all;
	\item Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item They are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity;
		\item They are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle; according to the MaxMin principle in game theory)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise Answers}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are weaknesses of the deontological approach?\\
	Deontology holds that some choices cannot be justified by their effects and thus are morally always forbidden. But this leads to justification for helping in unjust acts and still be morally clean. For example driving a robber to his robbery target. It also allows that each one of us is morally sound, but the world is becoming much worse. Also, in my opinion the sole focus on the moral self is unattractive and per definition selfish.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Utilitarian Ethics}
The term utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism and encompasses theoretical approaches of ethics which evaluate the moral value of an action based on its consequences.
\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Utilitarianism}, the ethics of maximising utility, makes the moral evaluation of an action or a rule of action dependent on its consequences. Being moral is to achieve maximum utility (happiness or well-being) for the highest number of people.
\end{definition}
Happiness is understood as a net balance of positive and negative states of well-being.  An action is good if it increases both individual happiness and the happiness of the community.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Basic Principles}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consequentialism\\
	Assessing the consequences of an action, evaluating the common wellbeing
	\item Eudemonism\\
	Happiness or wellbeing as the most important good
	\item Teleological Ethics\\
	The goal is maximizing happiness in the world
	\item Individualism\\
	Effects, aggregated to each individual; Individual happiness is added, individual suffering deducted
	\item Universalism\\
	Individuals have the same weighting (maybe even animals)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/act-rule-utilitarianism}
	\caption{Option: Decisive decision-making criterion are action or rule}
	\label{fig:act-rule-utilitarianism}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/happiness-preference-utilitarianism}
	\caption{Option: happiness or preference}
	\label{fig:happiness-preference-utilitarianism}
\end{figure}

According to Jeremy Betham (1748-1832) the core thesis is the \textit{Maximum Happiness Principle}, the striving for pleasure and avoidance of suffering. He introduces the \textbf{utility principle} which appraises every action according to the extent to which it increases the happiness of the community more than it diminishes it.

%TODO Check if formatting is still fine
\clearpage
Bentham postulates the \textbf{felicific calculus} (also called utility or hedonistic calculus) to calculate the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to cause, in principle this allows to determine the moral status of any action.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Intensity}\\
	How strong is the pleasure?
	\item \textbf{Duration}\\
	How long will the pleasure last?
	\item \textbf{Certainty or uncertainty}\\
	How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will occur?
	\item \textbf{Propinquity or remoteness}\\
	How soon will the pleasure occur?
	\item \textbf{Fecundity}\\
	The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind.
	\item \textbf{Purity}\\
	The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.
	\item \textbf{Extent}\\
	How many people will be affected?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Applied Ethics and Sustainable Development}
The current world is an amalgamation of world views and different symbolic organisation with differing actions and options (\textbf{pluralism}). There is a complexity of contexts and situations with conflicts of interests, orientation problems and possible conflicts of conscience. Ethics can be a basis for reasoned judgements and actions which can help shape and design of just institutions.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Applied ethics} is a philosophical discipline of problem-related ethics with moral problems in selected areas. Discourses and catalogues of standards on single topics with a focus on a specific theme.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{img/applied_ethics_level}
	\caption{Levels of applied ethics}
	\label{fig:appliedethicslevel}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Macro Level\\Economics and social ethics; the state decides laws, framework conditions and guiding principles
	\item Meso Level\\Business Ethics and Corporate Responsibility; a company decides on its working conditions, product range, handling of its resources, and on the corporate philosophy and culture
	\item Micro Level\\Individual Ethics; the individual decides on its behaviour
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Relativism Debate}
Relativism denies the universal validity of ethical standards. Relativism principle states that there is no rational method for testing ethical principles. But as a counterargument one can observe that there is an independent standpoint of morality with rational evaluation of principles, values and justifications.

\subsection{Sustainable Development}
\begin{definition}
	Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
\end{definition}
The model of sustainability has the ethical starting point of having the responsibility for future generations and thus the postulate of intergenerational justice.
\begin{definition}
	Responsibility is the state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or of having control over someone.
\end{definition}
It means the obligation to act as a subject for an object. \parencite{gobel2013unternehmensethik}

\subsubsection{Responsibility - Level I (Anthropocentric)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Everyone only takes care of himself
	\item In addition to themselves, everyone takes care of their family, friends and acquaintances as well as their immediate ancestors
	\item Everyone takes care of himself, those close to him and his fellow citizens or the people to whom he belongs, including the immediate heritage of the past
	\item Everyone takes care of himself, those close to him, his own people, and the present living generations of all humanity
	\item Everyone takes into consideration himself, those who are close to him, his own people, the present living generations of all humanity, all ancestors and those born after, that is, humanity as a whole
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Responsibility - Level II (Physiocentric)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Everybody takes \textbf{humanity as a whole} and \textbf{all consciously feeling living beings} (individuals and species) into consideration
	\item Everyone takes \textbf{all living things} (individuals and species) into consideration
	\item Everyone shows consideration \textbf{for everything}

\subsection{Key Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Instability
	\item Implementation\\The laws have to be implemented on a local level, this process is slow and decentralised
	\item Governance\\Politicians are not that interested in implementing changes, as they have very short term goals (next election)
\end{itemize}

\section{Future and Digital Ethics}
Future ethics concerns itself with the responsibility of actions with regard to consequences, especially the impact they have on future generations, and thus deals with issues that have long-term effects on people, society and nature, and which are thus not easily foreseeable.

Hans Jonas was a philosopher whose research into Gnosticism was the foundation work for a long time. Furthermore, he wrote the book \textit{The Imperative Of Responsibility} which centres on social and ethical problems created by technology and its use. His ideas encompassed that nature has intrinsic value, and that humanity has the duty to care for the future of all nature on this planet as a necessary condition of it's own \parencite{jonas1984imperative}. Complications are the limited predictions one can make based on current knowledge and the increasing vulnerability of nature. He argues that humanity should veer from the idea of a better life in terms of greater consumption towards a better life of ethical and cultural quality and of sociopolitical order.

\subsection{Ecological Imperative}
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Act so that the effects of your actions are compatible with the permanence of real human life on earth.
	\item Act so that the effects of your actions are not destructive to the future possibility of such life.
	\item Do not endanger the conditions for the indefinite existence of mankind on earth.
	\item Include in your present choice the future integrity of man as a co-object of your will.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scheme for Ethical Decision Making}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Analyze facts\\
	Collect basic information and scientific findings
	\item Analyze interests and areas of conflict\\
	Identify stakeholders with their interests, claims and rights at a micro, meso and macro level
	\item Evaluate and justify\\
	Evaluation and consideration, that is virtue ethics, deontological and teleological ethics; statement and justification
	\item Propose measures\\
	Measures for implementation on a micro, meso and macro level
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Information and Digital Ethics}
\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Information ethics} is a field of applied ethics that deals with the handling of information and information and communication technologies under moral and ethical aspects.
\end{definition}

The motivation of information ethics lies in the growing importance of information, which is also described as a change towards an information society. When dealing with knowledge and information in virtual spaces, new moral concepts and norms emerge (for example hacker ethics, netiquette), which are investigated and discussed in the context of information ethics.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Digital ethics} is a subcategory of information ethics and partly a continuation of approaches of media ethics. It examines how digital media and technologies are used by individuals and organisations, the social context they are used in, and which approaches can be negotiated to solve problems and conflicts that arise in this context.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Areas of Application}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Proprietary rights to information
	\item Aspects of freedom of information
	\item Overcoming a digital divide between people with and without access to information
	\item Informational self-determination and the protection of privacy in view of growing possibilities of surveillance (data privacy)
	\item Necessity of restrictions on the dissemination of information due to the protection of personality and/or child protection
	\item Economization and the digital transformation of the work environment
	\item Privacy and data protection
	\item Change in values in the course of digitization, especially values such as privacy and autonomy
	\item Cyberbullying
	\item Doxxing or Hacking
	\item Artificial intelligence and the increasing importance of robotics
	\item Points of contact with machine ethics
	\item Human-technology interaction
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Central Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Opportunities and side effects of technology
	\item Risks of technology
	\item Influence of technology on the human self-image and the culture we want to live in
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conflicting Goals}
\textbf{Balancing values}
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Accessibility versus Privacy
	\item Individualisation and Personalisation versus Privacy
	\item Customer satisfaction versus Freedom of choice
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Balancing interests}
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Insight versus Privacy
	\item Law enforcement versus Privacy
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Impact assessment}
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Future options versus appropriate data use
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise}
Sustainable information systems can carry the values of the engineers and designers. This can help in recognising potential customer value propositions and customer needs. However, sustainability is in itself a value which depends on a holistic long-term value consideration, and is thus not likely to be considered by managers and companies with short-term profit orientations.

\section{Business Ethics and Code of Ethics}
Subject areas of Business Ethics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Corporate Ethics
	\item Consumer Ethics
	\item Economic Order
	\item Financial Market Ethics
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}
	Business ethics is a field of applied ethics. It does not offer applicable knowledge (how to do something) but critical \textbf{normative orientation knowledge} (what to do).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Business Ethics Approaches Overview}
\subsubsection{Republican Approach}
The profit principle of the market is sacrosanct and not questioned, so employing ethics always costs money. Standards guiding action should be developed in dialogue and consensus oriented in the way that the better argument has priority. Ethical leadership contributes to the legitimisation of corporate action.

The shortcomings of this approach are that ideal discourse is difficult to have and that the profit principle is not critically investigated.

\subsubsection{Economic Approach}
The economic liberal approach strives for an economic justification of ethics. The market economy is not questioned, as it leads to the most welfare in society. The place of morality is in the general regulatory framework. Deficits arise when the regulatory framework reacts with a time lag to technical, economic, and social changes.

The shortcomings lie in that the idea of a regulatory framework order is too idealistic, and not applicable to the globalised world (no global regulatory institution). It focusses more on rule-conformal behaviour and not on moral consciousness.

\subsubsection{Integrative Approach}
The entrepreneurial pursuit of success and profit is subordinated to the normative condition of legitimacy. The purpose of all entrepreneurial activity is the creation of value to satisfy individual human and social needs. Ethics is thus a task for the entire company including measures to promote corporate responsibility.

The shortcomings of this approach are that it presupposes a basic conflict between ethics and business, it does not try to solve the conflict but instead postulates the ethics as centre stage.

\subsection{Recognising an Ethical Issue}
Leading questions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is this issue about more than what is legal or what is most efficient? If so, in what way?
	\item Does this decision involve a choice between a good and bad alternative, or perhaps between two "goods" or two "bads?"
	\item Could this decision or situation be damaging to an individual or a group?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Codes of Conduct}
The codes of conduct (CoC) are a compliance instrument for ethics management in companies, sectors or industries. They describe or establish compliance with certain standards and rules of conduct, and are part of the risk management. They provide a value framework within which a company or industry wishes to conduct its business.

Often at least these three areas are covered
\begin{itemize}
	\item Business ethics\\
	bribery, competition, conflicts of interest, legal provisions
	\item Responsibility for the environment
	\item Social responsibility\\
	human rights, employees, unions
\end{itemize}

\section{Corporate Responsibility}
Traditional Definitions of Corporate Responsibility
\begin{definition}
	Corporate Social Responsibility is the ongoing commitment of companies to contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of employees, their families, the community and society as a whole.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	$[...]$ socially responsible companies try to maximize profits while improving the welfare of other stakeholders.
\end{definition}

\vspace*{1em}
\noindent
Definition that would be signed by most economists
\begin{definition}
	Corporate responsibility describes the way a company takes responsibility for the solution of societal challenges while pursuing the company’s overriding objective.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item corporate: relating to a company or corporation
		\item responsibility: something for which one is responsible; a duty, an obligation, or a burden
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Categories of Corporate Responsibility Topics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Responsibility or Accountability
	\item Human Rights
	\item Working Conditions
	\item Ethical behavior
	\item Corporate Governance
	\item Environmental Protection and Conservation
	\item Market and Consumption

\section{Stakeholder Identification}
\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{business case} is a Forecast of the consequences of an action or decision for the achievement of the highest corporate objective.
\end{definition}

Corporate responsibility requires the use of resources, which must be managed carefully by a competitive company. Thus corporate responsibility must therefore be supported by a business case.

	\textbf{Problem}\\ Value drivers are much more difficult to measure and express in monetary units than costs, and Business Cases are always approximations.
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Value Drivers Which Improve Companies Financial Performance}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maintaining a good corporate reputation or brand equity
	\item Attracting, motivating and retaining talented employees
	\item Meeting societal expectations for good corporate behaviour
	\item Improving operational efficiency or decreasing costs
	\item Opening new growth opportunities
	\item Improving risk management
	\item Strengthening competitive position
	\item Improving access to capital
\end{enumerate}
Source: McKinsey \& Company (2009); McKinsey Global Survey Results: Valuing corporate social responsibility

\subsection{Categories of Value Drivers}
\subsubsection{Market–Product–Customers}
Corporate responsibility issues can give rise to the development of new products, technologies, and services, or the upgrading of existing products, technologies, and services. This capacity for innovation can open new markets or customer segments. In this way, a better market position and higher sales volumes or prices can be sought.

\subsubsection{Production–Process–Resources}
Consideration of corporate responsibility issues with regard to the optimization of processes can lead to better quality of work, better social benefits, and better protection for employees. This type of value proposition leads to greater employee satisfaction, increased motivation, and higher productivity. Operational efficiency is increased by the above factors, and costs fall as a result.

\subsubsection{Reputation–Regulation–Public Image}
The reputation of a company is significantly influenced by how it handles stakeholder expectations. If it is sensitive to expectations in relation to corporate responsibility issues, fulfils these wholly or in part, and publicizes its efforts, this will help to preserve its license to operate. Conversely, loss of reputation can lead to high recovery costs.

\subsubsection{Finance-Risk}
A systematic approach to corporate responsibility issues reduces associated risks. Therefore, the risk position of the company from an investor perspective is improved. Thanks to a better risk position, the company has easier access to its own and borrowed capital.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
	\item Corporate responsibility activities need to suit to the company: should be pursued in the way \textbf{most appropriate to each company's strategy and situation}
	\item Corporate responsibility management can be positive or negative for company performance\\It is \textbf{more likely to be profitable, if actively linked to value drivers}, which include \textbf{product innovation, efficiency, reputation, and access to capital}
	\item Benefit of Business Case of corporate responsibility \textbf{is often difficult to quantify}, but it is possible in many cases and should be done much more often

Investors are mainly focussed on economic indicators, but sustainability rankings by sustainability rating agencies can be a decisive factor in investment decisions, if two companies are economically at a comparable level.

\subsection{Shared Value Approach}
The reaction of companies to societal challenges is often cosmetic, not strategic or substantial. However, the Corporate Responsibility field remains strongly linked with a moral imperative (absolute), companies in contrast need to balance competing interests and costs (relative). The Sustainability field \textbf{offers little to balance long-term objectives and short-term costs}. The Creating Shared Value (CSV) approach tries to bridge economy and society.

\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft Not all profit is equal. Profits involving a social purpose represent a higher form of capitalism, one that creates a positive cycle of company and community prosperity.\textquotedblright
\end{quote}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Creating shared value} involves policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates \parencite{kramer2011creating}.
\end{definition}

\vspace*{1em}
\noindent
The CSV approach works by \textbf{integration of a social perspective into the core framework} the company already uses to understand competition and guide its business strategy. \textbf{Creating a social dimension to the value proposition},  \textbf{identification of social dimensions} of a company’s competitive context, and \textbf{defining customers' needs}. It directly links to the company value creation and profit maximization. This strategic approach is very specific to the company to differentiate in the market and to choose a unique position.

\subsubsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Rethink Products and Markets}\\
	Identify all the societal needs, benefits, and harms that are or could be embodied in the firm’s products, which leads to new product innovations
	\item  \textbf{Redefine Productivity in the Value Chain}\\
	Congruence between societal progress and productivity: better efficiency, securing of resources
	\item \textbf{Enable Local Cluster Development}\\
	Geographical concentrations of firms, related businesses, suppliers, service providers and logistical infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Benefits}
Socially and environmentally, shared value can vastly improve the conditions of a society, advancing community health, education, employment, service access and participation, and helping to conserve wildlife and environments. The economic benefits for a company granted by shared value are also numerous, and include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}[label=-, nosep]
	\item Self-sustaining purpose and profitability
	\item Stronger brand equity and marketability
	\item Increased customer preference and loyalty
	\item Higher advocacy, retention and productivity among employees
	\item Resilience against external business threats
	\item Regained credibility among a disillusioned public
	\item Enhanced or sustained interest from like-minded shareholders and investors
\end{itemize}
\section{Corporate Responsibility Goal Setting}
\citeauthor{stead2008sustainable} base their approach on the works of early business management scholars like Taylor 

\subsection{Plan Objectives and Measures}
Operational objectives are \textbf{specific short to medium term goals}, which are \textbf{derived from the strategic objectives}. They \textbf{make these strategic objectives measurable and verifiable}, and thus serve as a guide in the implementation phase. They are required to be \textbf{s}pecific, \textbf{m}easurable, \textbf{a}ccepted, \textbf{r}ealistic and \textbf{t}ime-based.

	\textbf{Principles} & Within two years, all sites will have adopted gender equality into their human resources policy\\
	\textbf{Processes} & In the coming year, at each location, a minimum of 20 female participants will have taken part in the mentoring program\\
	\textbf{Effects} & Within three years, the percentage of women in lower and middle management will have increased across all locations by 20\% compared to the base value target date\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Relevance of Indicators in the Measurement of Objectives}
Indicators are necessary to measure the achievement of objectives and need to be defined for the operational objectives. A corporate responsibility indicator can be defined as information which characterises the performance of organizations regarding a particular corporate responsibility issue. These indicators must be collected at regular intervals. Indicators can also be used at different organisational levels.

\subsection{Developing Measures}
To achieve the operational objectives of corporate responsibility issues, specific measures need to be developed. This applies to all activities which are carried out to meet objectives, such as adapting processes and structures, or implementing programs and projects.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/developing_achievable_measures}
	\caption{Matrix to classify and design defined measures to achieve strategic goals}
	\label{fig:developingachievablemeasures}
\end{figure}
Companies need to rethink the way they measure and set goals on environmental and social performance. Current goals are most often set in comparison to their peer group, which makes them very unambitious. Linking sustainability goals to business outcomes is not only vital, it is also very often missing from the storyline. Often times, setting sustainability goals involve too many topics, and are not focussed enough to be meaningful targets. Environmental and social context is also missing from most sustainability targets, resulting in goals that lack sufficient ambition.

\section{Corporate Responsibility Management Structures and Stakeholder Engagement}
\subsection{Implementation of a Corporate Responsibility Strategy}
Key tasks during the implementation phase of corporate responsibility issues are the design of appropriate work structures and the promotion of an enterprise culture. Both are needed to integrate and implement the principles, strategies, objectives, and measures within the company.

\vspace*{0.5em}

\subsection{Corporate Responsibility Management Tasks}
Central questions are \textit{what tasks have to be fulfilled} and \textit{which units will be in charge of a task}?

		\item Implement individual actions and projects related to the issue
		\item Collect data and information for reviewing target achievement
	\end{itemize}
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Organising Corporate Responsibility Tasks}
Various units are involved in carrying out and reviewing tasks:
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{p{0.3\linewidth} X}
	\textbf{Divisions} & Corporate responsibility issues linked to functions\\
	\textbf{Specialist Department} & Corporate responsibility issues are often interdisciplinary topics which cut across organisational units. This needs to be reflected in these structures. Rather than being entrusted to one division, the responsibility for performance is exercised by a specialist department.\\
	\textbf{Responsible Persons in Different Divisions} & In affected organisational units, individuals are appointed to deal with issues. This can take on various different forms. One person can deal exclusively with corporate responsibility issues, but an individual assumes responsibility for such issues in addition to its other duties.\\
	\textbf{Steering Committees} & Handling of corporate responsibility issues through cross-cutting committees. Their function is to bring together information from the lines and other cross-cutting functions, without substantially altering competencies and responsibilities.\\
	\textbf{Project Teams} & Implementing single and individual corporate responsibility projects.\\
	\textbf{Combining different organisational forms} & A combination of various forms is especially recommended for large organizations. A specialist department acts as a focal point, while a cross-sectional committee coordinates the various tasks between divisions.
\end{tabularx}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most operational sequences occur repeatedly in a company
	\item Important to achieve a common understanding of these processes,
	\item To achieve such understanding, processes need to be described and explained (e.g. by using diagrams)
	\item Common classifications are management processes, implementation (also core or performance) and support processes.
	\item For corporate responsibility issues, it is often necessary to \textbf{adapt} existing processes or \textbf{introduce} new ones.

\subsection{Development of a Corporate Culture for Corporate Responsibility}
\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{corporate culture} is understood as the total number of value convictions, thought patterns and behavioural norms that have been consciously or unconsciously cultivated, symbolically or linguistically handed down in the company, which have developed and proven themselves and which are therefore conveyed to the company's employees as valid forms of perception, thinking, judging, speaking and behaviour. (Schein, 1985 and Ulrich, 1984)

\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Influencing Behaviour and Overcoming Resistance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Incentives}\\ Give out bonuses for top achievers of a specific goal
	\item \textbf{Compliance}\\ Draw up a set of regulations which must be signed and complied with on risk of dismissal
	\item \textbf{Integrity}\\ Extensive training of all involved parties, with workshops on the consequence of that specific topic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholder Engagement}
The benefits of stakeholder engagement involve
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exchange of knowledge and experience
	\item Gaining an outside view, overcoming operational blindness and narrow focus
	\item Identifying issues early, having an early warning system
	\item Preventing criticism, lifting blockades
	\item Anticipation and development of new solutions
	\item Greater acceptance of decisions and actions through stakeholder involvement in development processes
	\item Improved relationships, building trust
	\item Development of innovative solutions, services and products through cooperation
	\item Building reputation and securing the licence to operate

\section{Corporate Responsibility Communication and Controlling}
Communication matters in how transparent and credible the reporting, especially on non-financial topics, is, and how the corporate responsibility activities and communications are perceived by your shareholders.

\subsubsection{Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Reporting Standards}
The modular, interrelated GRI Standards are designed primarily to be used as a set, to prepare a sustainability report focused on material topics. The three universal Standards are used by every organization that prepares a sustainability report. An organization also chooses from the topic-specific Standards to report on its material topics – economic, environmental or social.

\subsection{EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting}
Financial and non-financial reporting provides shareholders and other stakeholders with a meaningful, comprehensive view of the position and performance of companies. Large public-interest entities designated by EU member states with more than
five-hundred employees should disclose relevant and useful information on their policies, main risks and outcomes in their management report, relating to at least
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item environmental matters
	\item social and employee aspects
	\item respect for human rights
	\item anticorruption and bribery issues
	\item diversity in their board of directors
\end{itemize}
There is significant flexibility for companies to disclose relevant information (including reporting in a separate report), as well as they may rely on international, European or national guidelines.

\subsubsection{United Nation Global Compact (UNGC)}
The aim and vision of the UN Global Compact is to mobilise a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create a world everybody can live in.

To achieve this, the UNGC supports companies to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do business responsibly by aligning their strategies and operations with Ten Principles\footnote{\href{https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles}{UNGC Principles}} on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption
	\item Take strategic actions to advance broader societal goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals\footnote{\href{https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/our-work/sustainable-development/sdgs}{The Sustainable Development Goals}}, with an emphasis on collaboration and innovation
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The Ten Principles}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label=, noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Human Rights}
	\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
		\item Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and
		\item Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Labour}
	\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
		\item Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;
		\item Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;
		\item Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and
		\item Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Environment}
	\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
		\item Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;
		\item Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and
		\item Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Anti-Corruption}
	\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
		\item Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)}
Members have to fill out a survey every year. This survey includes performance measures and indicators the companies have to report on. Subsequently, the survey is analysed by the GRESB committee. The company receives feedback and results, and for industries and regions, the GRESB provides a benchmark study.

\subsubsection{Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)}
PRI reporting is the largest global
reporting project on responsible investment. It was developed with investors, for investors. Signatories are required to report on their responsible investment activities annually.

\section{Corporate Responsibility Controlling}
Controlling is needed, as otherwise
\begin{quote}
	\textquotedblleft If it‘s not counted, it won‘t be noticed.\textquotedblright\\
	\hspace*{1em} - Alex MacGillivray, Simon Zadek
\end{quote}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The status of the company on the topic should be assessed and possibly compared with other companies (\textbf{benchmarking})
	\item The performance on corporate responsibility topics should be specifically controlled with targets and action plans (\textbf{controlling})
	\item The development of performance regarding the set targets should be tracked (\textbf{controlling})
	\item The status and development of performance on the topic should be communicated externally (\textbf{reporting})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Added Value of Reporting and Benchmarking}
\paragraph{Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Creating a basis for reporting and communicating corporate responsibility issues internally and externally;
	\item Demonstrating to external stakeholders the extent to which the objectives have been met and that the success of corporate responsibility management is regularly reviewed, with measures taken when necessary.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Benchmarking}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assessing the state and success of the company's corporate responsibility management and comparing it to other companies
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Controlling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determining to what extent the strategy for corporate responsibility issues has been implemented;
	\item Determining to what extent the objectives have been achieved;
	\item Reviewing strategic and operational objectives as to their usefulness and revising them, if appropriate;
	\item Tracking the development of corporate responsibility performance over time;
	\item Questioning assumptions or actions related to corporate responsibility issues;
	\item Planning and controlling resources for corporate responsibility management better (learning effect);
	\item Visualizing and analysing relationships between causes and effects.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reasons for Deviations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Unrealistic Goals}\\ Goals that (a) are not based on experience or are not set by industry experts, and (b) are based on unrealistic assumptions
	\item \textbf{Poor Planning of Measures}\\ Courses of action unlikely to achieve the desired improvement in performance (that is on account of incorrect information about the relationship between cause and effect)
	\item \textbf{Poor Implementation}\\ Failure to implement suitable measures (that is owing to improper resources, unclear responsibilities, wrong incentives, trade-offs, or lack of expertise on the part of those responsible)
	\item \textbf{Unforeseen External and Internal Influences}\\ Examples of \textbf{external} influences include natural disasters, government regulatory measures, or crises related to corporate responsibility issues (combined with unexpected public attention towards the company)\\ Examples of \textbf{internal} influences include corporate reorganization
	\item \textbf{Deliberate Misconduct, Deception, Manipulation}\\ Conduct intended to sabotage the achievement of objectives or the effectiveness of measures
	\item \textbf{Unfavourable Conditions}\\ Examples include a lack of commitment by managers to achieving set objectives; a corporate culture that is opposed to the achievement of targets
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functions of Top Level Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Maintain What Works}\\ Analyse what works well and why; make sure it stays that way
	\item \textbf{Improve What Doesn't Work}\\ Analyse what does not work so well and why; identify obstacles and barriers, and initiate changes
	\item \textbf{Review Objectives}\\ Revisit original objectives and, where appropriate, take corrective action and set new goals
	\item \textbf{Ensure the Support of Senior Management}\\ The commitment of executives is crucial; for this reason, their involvement in major decision-making is essential
	\item \textbf{Track Current Trends}\\ Senior management should be familiar with major developments both within and outside the company
	\item \textbf{Provide Resources}\\ Decisions must be taken at an executive level to ensure the necessary resources for further development are made available
	\item \textbf{Celebrate Achievements}\\ An assessment of a past period is an excellent opportunity to celebrate achievements with awards, prizes, or certificates, preferably involving all stakeholders
